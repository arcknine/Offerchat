          Why do I sign up for Free when I want a paid plan
        The free signup is only to create your Offerchat account. You can click upgrade to a Paid plan and start your subscription right after registration.
      %li
        %h3
          Do I have to go through a Free trial?
        No, you don't have to. There is no required free trial in Offerchat. Once, you've signed up, you can immediately upgrade to a paid plan from the dashboard anytime you need to.
      %li
        %h3
          Are there existing feature limitations in each plan?
        No. Pricing revolves around the number of agent seats and not features. So you can enjoy all Offerchat features fully no matter which plan you choose. Sounds good? Great!
